Spark lets us spread data and computations over clusters with multiple nodes (think of each node as a separate computer). Splitting up data makes it easier to work with very large datasets because each node only works with a small amount of data.\n","As each node works on its own subset of the total data, it also carries out a part of the total calculations required, so that both data processing and computation are performed in parallel over the nodes in the cluster. It is a fact that parallel computation can make certain types of programming tasks much faster.\n","\n","Deciding whether or not Spark is the best solution for your problem takes some experience, but you can consider questions like:\n","* Is my data too big to work with on a single machine?\n","* Can my calculations be easily parallelized?\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["../input/titanic/test.csv\n","../input/titanic/train.csv\n"]}],"source":["# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n","# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n","# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n","\n","import numpy as np # linear algebra\n","import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n","\n","# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n","# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('../input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","\n","# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n","# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: pyspark in /Users/masumrumi/.local/share/virtualenvs/pyspark_titanic-AKXOLEKJ/lib/python3.11/site-packages (3.5.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: py4j==0.10.9.7 in /Users/masumrumi/.local/share/virtualenvs/pyspark_titanic-AKXOLEKJ/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from pyspark) (0.10.9.7)\n"]}],"source":["## installing pyspark\n","!pip install pyspark"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The first step in using Spark is connecting to a cluster. In practice, the cluster will be hosted on a remote machine that's connected to all other nodes. There will be one computer, called the master that manages splitting up the data and the computations. The master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called worker. The master sends the workers data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.\n","\n","We definitely don't need may clusters for Titanic dataset. In addition to that, the syntax for running locally or using many clusters are pretty similar. To start working with Spark DataFrames, we first have to create a SparkSession object from SparkContext. We can think of the SparkContext as the connection to the cluster and SparkSession as the interface with that connection. Let's create a SparkSession.
